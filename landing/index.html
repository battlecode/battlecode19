    <h3>What is Battlecode?</h3>
    <p>
        Battlecode is a real-time strategy game, for which you will write an AI player. In Battlecode, two teams of
        virtual robots roam the screen managing resources and executing different offensive strategies against each
        other. Your AI player will need to strategically manage your robot army and control how your robots work
        together to defeat the enemy team. As a contestants, you will learn to use artificial intelligence,
        pathfinding, distributed algorithms, and network communications to make your player as competitive as possible.
        <br><br>
        Teams are given the Battlecode software and a specification of the game rules in early January. Throughout
        the month, you will refine your player, and compete in scrimmages and tournaments against other teams.
        During these tournaments, the autonomous players are pitted against each other in a dramatic head-to-head
        fashion. At the end of the month, the Final Tournament is played out in front of a live audience in MIT's
        Kresge Auditorium, with the top teams receiving cash prizes. The total prize pool is over $50,000.

    <dl>
        <dt><b>What languages are supported?</b></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Battlecode 2019 will allow you to write a bot Javascript, Python, and Java.  As our stack is open source (as usual), more adventurous souls will be able to experiment with different languages of their choosing. Stay tuned for updates, and let us know if there is another language you would like us to support!

        <dt><b>So Battlecode is a game AI competition? But what's the game?</b></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                We can't tell you yet, and we won't reveal this year's game until Battlecode 2019 kicks off on
                January 7th. The game changes every year, and part of the fun of Battlecode is in not knowing what
                you're gonna get :). However, we can tell you that the game tends to be a  turn-based strategy game, and robots need to demonstrate a mastery of both broad resource management (macro),
                and organized, efficient combat tactics (micro).
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Do I have to be good at programming?</b></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Experience definitely helps, but everyone has to start somewhere. A background in algorithms and AI
                is not necessary. We'll be available throughout January to help you out as needed through our lecture series on Twitch and on the Discord. If you have
                little or no experience in programming, then we encourage you to consider Battlecode as a fun,
                engaging project through which you will pick up the skills you need to write programs!
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Is it okay if I have no AI background?</b></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                That's completely okay. Many competitors have no AI experience coming in. We will be holding daily
                lectures through January, which will cover various topics in game AI, such as pathfinding, resource
                management, and combat tactics (micro). These lectures will be streamed and uploaded online, so
                fear not if you are participating remotely!
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt><b>What is the tournament format?</b></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                We will be holding several tournaments throughout the month
                of January. The penultimate tournament will determine the finalists who will compete at MIT in the
                Final Tournament. In parallel to this series of tournaments (the "main" event), we will also be
                holding a Newbie Tournament open to MIT students who have not previously competed in Battlecode,
                as well as a High School Tournmanet open to both US and International middle/high school students.

            <p>A scrimmage is a friendly game between two teams, and you can watch and analyze the games afterwards.
                This allows a team to test their strategies against other teams. Scrimmaging will be available as
                soon as Battlecode begins.</p>

                Battlecode is an official 6-unit MIT course, with the course number 6.147. In addition to
                registering on this site once IAP starts, you must also register for 6.147 through MIT's system. At that point, in order to
                get credit, you must create a player that is able to beat a reference player that we will release
                later in the tournament.

    <a id="battlecode-conduct"><h3>Code of Conduct</h3></a>
    <p>Maintaining a safe and inclusive environment for competitors is a top priority for Battlecode. Battlecode
        strictly follows <a class="page-link" href="https://policies-procedures.mit.edu/">MIT's Policies</a>
        on responsible and ethical conduct. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please
        report it to Teh Devs as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value
        of the competition for everyone. People like you make our community a better place, and we want you to be
        happy here.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Harrassment:</b> Battlecode is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless
            of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
            size, race, age, religion, or nationality. We do not tolerate harassment of competitors in any form.</li>
        <li><b>Bug Exploitation:</b> Battlecode is a rapidly-growing competition with many infrastructural challenges. Let
            us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue. Knowingly exposing
            vulnerabilities to the public as anything more than a minimal proof of concept is not allowed.
            Intentionally exploiting bugs that compromise the fairness of scrimmages and tournaments, or the
            security of the competition, is not tolerated.</li>
        <li><b>Academic Misconduct:</b> Academic misconduct is conduct by which a person misrepresents their academic
            accomplishments, or impedes others' opportunities of being judged fairly for their academic work. This
            includes but is not limited to plagiarism and knowingly allowing another person to represent your work
            as their own.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you find that your behavior questionably follows these guidelines, please reconsider your actions.
        Competitors violating these rules may be banned from current and/or future Battlecode competitions at the
        discretion of Teh Devs.</p>

    <a id="tournaments-overview"><h3>Tournament Overview</h3></a>
    <p>
        Battlecode 2019 will consist of 6 tournaments: the Sprint Tournament, the Seeding Tournament, the US
        Qualifying Tournament, the International Qualifying Tournament, the Newbie Tournament, the High School
        Tournament, and the Final Tournament. We stream and commentate all tournaments online. We may also have
        some bonus (for-fun) tournaments.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Sprint Tournament:</b> One week after spec release, you're given a
            chance to win small prizes in this tournament. The goal is to get an
            idea of the meta-game, and a chance to test your bot prototypes.</li>
        <li><b>Seeding Tournament:</b> One week after the Sprint Tournament, this
            tournament determines your positioning in the Qualifying
            Tournament.</li>
        <li><b>US and International Qualifying Tournaments:</b> This year, to allow
            adequate time for international finalists to plan travel to the US for the
            Final Tournament, there will be <b>separate qualifying tournaments for US
                and international teams</b>. These tournaments determine the contestants going
            into the Final Tournament, and showcase the final strategies of all the
            competitors. The top 8 teams from the US Qualifying Tournament and the top
            8 teams from the International Qualifying Tournament will qualify for the
            Final Tournament.</li>
        <li><b>Newbie Tournament:</b> As part of the Final Tournament, the top MIT newbie
            teams compete for a prize.</li>
        <li><b>High School Tournament:</b> Starting in 2017, the top high school teams also
            compete for a prize.</li>
        <li><b>Final Tournament:</b> At the end of IAP, the top teams compete for
            glory and fame live in MIT's Kresge auditorium.</li>
    </ul>

    <md-divider class="ng-scope"></md-divider>
    <h3>Eligibility</h3>
    <p>
        Teams must consist entirely of active students to be eligible for the Seeding, Qualifying, and Final
        Tournaments. An active student is a person who is currently enrolled as a full-time student in an eligible
        degree or certificate program. As an exception, we consider those transitioning immediately after high school
        and formally committed to such a program to be active students, including those taking gap years or in
        compulsory military service.
        <br><br>
        Active students also include those who are currently in high school (or some equivalent of secondary education
        or lower). Active MIT students who have never competed in Battlecode before (submitted a bot) are eligible
        for the Newbie Tournament. U.S. high school students and earlier are eligible for the High School Tournament.
        <br><br>
        Teams consisting entirely of US students compete in the US Qualifying Tournament. If your team has at least
        one non-US competitor, your team will compete in the International Qualifying Tournament. A US student is a
        student who attends a school in the United States.
        <br><br>
        If your team does not consist of active students, you may still compete in Battlecode for fun! All teams are
        allowed to scrimmage, and compete in the Sprint Tournament or any other bonus tournaments we may decide to
        hold. Contact us if you are unsure of your eligibility.
    </p>

    <h3>Dates & Deadlines</h3>
    <p>
        See the <a class="page-link" href="#battlecode-schedule">schedule</a> for all the important dates. The submission deadline for all tournaments, except the Newbie,
        High School, and Final Tournaments, will be at <b>8pm EST the night before the tournament</b>. Unlike in past years,
        finalists for these tournaments will be able to submit code after the Qualifying Tournament, up until <b>Wednesday,
        January 31st at 8pm</b>.
        <br><br>
        Even if you miss earlier tournaments, you can participate in later tournaments (except the Final Tournament).
        This includes the Qualifying Tournament - you can participate even if you miss every other tournament.
    </p>

    <md-divider class="ng-scope"></md-divider>
    <h3>Tournament Format</h3>
    <p>
        Scrimmage rankings will be used to determine seeds for the Sprint and Seeding Tournaments. For all other
        tournaments, results from the previous tournament will be used to seed teams.
        <br><br>
        Tournaments will be in a double elimination format, with the exception of the Sprint Tournament, which is
        single elimination. The Final Tournament will start with a blank slate (any losses from the Qualifying Tournament are reset).
        <br><br>
        Each match within a tournament will consist of 3 games on 3 different maps, and the team that wins the most
        games will advance.

Shaw group is a global investment and technology development firm, founded in 1988, with offices around the world. While we’re known as a pioneer in quantitative investing, we also have considerable expertise in areas that involve fundamental analysis or portfolio manager discretion. Our firm has earned an international reputation for successful investing based on innovation, careful risk management, and the quality and depth of our research and staff. With a culture that combines some of the best aspects of academia, finance, and technology, we pride ourselves on a work environment that promotes collaboration, integrity, and a precise approach to solving problems.</p><p>Our staff includes world-class mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists, analysts, business-builders, and system architects relying on specialized trading, operational, and compliance expertise developed over 30 years.

The firm is committed to the well-being and happiness of our employees and recognizes that different people thrive in different types of environments: Some are most productive working in t-shirts or listening to music, while others need time away from the office to recharge after a challenging project. We also have pantries stocked with snacks and games, an on-site gym, guest speakers from a range of disciplines, volunteer and public service opportunities, museum memberships, and social events.</p></div>

    <h3 id="sponsors-interested">Why Sponsor Battlecode?</h3>
    <p>
        Ever wanted a way to filter through job applicants, and find only the best recruits? The Battlecode competition
        is just that. Because it attracts the "best of the best," Battlecode provides targeted results in three key areas:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Recruiting:</b> Sponsoring Battlecode is more than just having your name on a banner - Battlecode gives
            select companies unprecedented access to meet and recruit the cream of the crop of MIT programmers, both
            graduate and undergraduate. Representatives from sponsor companies will be invited to the Finalists'
            Celebration, a networking event where they will get to meet the top contestants personally. In addition,
            a book of the contestants' resumes will be collected and made available to sponsors.</li>
        <li><b>Exposure:</b> Battlecode is a prestigious competition that is well-known throughout the entire MIT community.
            Sponsors will have their logos displayed on our high-traffic web site and wherever Battlecode is advertised.
            Sponsors will also help award prizes and address the crowd at the final tournament.</li>
        <li><b>Involvement:</b> Sponsors will get to help make Battlecode a fun and rewarding experience. They will have
            access to the source code of all entries and be involved in the judging and awarding of academic prizes.</li>
    </ul>
